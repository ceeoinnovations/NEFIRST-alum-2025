# Projects

Here are some of the projects you can work on.  (See folders for more information on each project.)

## High Low - Nearest Neighbor

The user gathers high and low distance data points using the Qwiic twist as a UI. The program then utilizes a simple nearest neighbor algorithm to detect and classify objects (as "high" or "low" furniture) based on proximity, adjusting the servo motor position accordingly.

## Stop Sign - Linear Regression

By rotating and pressing the Qwiic Twist sensor, users can collect distance and speed data, which are used to perform a linear regression and subsequently control a robot using a proportional control algorithm based on the collected data.

## line Follower - Reinforcement Learning

The system uses Q-learning, where training data populates a Q-table of state-action pairs. Users can train the robot by pressing the Qwiic Twist, enabling it to learn optimal driving actions, and then test its performance by leveraging learned knowledge.
